## üìÅ Datasets and Notebooks

Each section/notebook implements a *full machine learning workflow* over a specific dataset, including acquisition, preparation, training, and performance reporting. All data are accessed automatically via [`ucimlrepo`](https://github.com/RUB-SysSec/ucimlrepo).

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

The core project code (notebook) follows this modular pipeline:

1. **Class Definition: WiSARD**
   - Custom Python implementation with support for variable address sizes and multi-class discrimination.
   - Internally manages binary address generation, RAM discriminators, and class votes.
2. **Data Loading**
   - Uses `ucimlrepo` to fetch open-access datasets seamlessly.
   - Displays variables, schema, and metadata for transparency.
3. **Preprocessing & Binarization**
   - Encodes categorical features using `pd.get_dummies`.
   - Scales data (`StandardScaler`) and binarizes both categorical and continuous features into bit-patterns suitable for WiSARD inputs.
4. **Train/Test Split**
   - Employs stratified splitting (typically 70% test, 30% train) to ensure class balance.
5. **Model Training**
   - Trains the WiSARD classifier by generating RAM addresses and populating class ontologies per input sample.
6. **Inference & Evaluation**
   - Each sample is classified by the model emitting the highest RAM vote.
   - Outputs overall accuracy and, where appropriate, interprets detailed performance per class.
7. **Critical Analysis**
   - Notes on biases, class imbalance, and dataset-model fit.
   - Comments highlight peculiarities (e.g., symbolic data, rule-based vs. learnable patterns).

## üß™ Example: Usage (Obesity Dataset)

from ucimlrepo import fetch_ucirepo
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, StandardScaler

WiSARD model (see included class definition)
class WiSARD:
...
# (Paste implementation from notebook here)

def binarize(data):
# Converts all features to binary string representation
...

1. Fetch dataset
data = fetch_ucirepo(id=544)
X = pd.get_dummies(data.data.features, drop_first=True)
y = LabelEncoder().fit_transform(np.array(data.data.targets).ravel())

2. Split and scale
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.7, random_state=42)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

3. Binarize
X_train_bin = binarize(X_train)
X_test_bin = binarize(X_test)

4. Instantiate and train WiSARD classifier
address_size = max(4, min(8, int(np.log2(X_train_bin.shape))))
model = WiSARD(address_size)
model.train(X_train_bin, y_train)

5. Predict and evaluate
y_pred = model.classify(X_test_bin)
accuracy = np.mean(np.array(y_test) == np.array(y_pred))
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2%}")
